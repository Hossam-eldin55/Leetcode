## ðŸ§© Problem: Move Zeroes

Given an array `nums`, write a function to move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

---

### ðŸ“˜ Description

You are provided with an array of integers. Your task is to modify the array in-place, such that:

- All `0` values are moved to the end of the array.
- The relative ordering of non-zero values remains unchanged.
- The solution must use constant extra space (`O(1)`).

This problem is useful for practicing in-place algorithms and understanding how to manipulate array elements efficiently without using additional memory.

#### Example
```python
Input:  [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
